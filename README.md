# sweeps
Parameter sweep utility in Python

## To-dos / nice-to-have features(?):
* Allow for a Git repository to be included in the sweep folder, and compute hashes based on the most current Git commit. For consistency, would also need to perform a checkout of the repo to the latest commit, discarding local changes.
